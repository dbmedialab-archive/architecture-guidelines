- Use component-based structures with templates, styling and test files in one folder
- Use TypeScript by default
- Use Prettier to get a common style for all code
- If a project needs shared components it should be in the Wolverine ecosystem
- Write tests
 - Test the end result (does the article components have an href etc.)
 - Write integration tests
 - Check out basic Jest example (when Just is finished)
 - Check out basic Storybook example (when Just is finished)
- Be critical to third party packages
 - Always check if there already is something in the package file that does what you need
 - If itâ€™s a small package: maybe just copy-paste code instead of adding a dependency?
- Write documentation 
 - Please write some comments about what your function does
 - Check for documentation in code reviews
- Do code reviews
 - Also do code reviews for quick fixes
