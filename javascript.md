- Use component-based structures with templates, styling and test files in one folder
- Use TypeScript by default
- Use Prettier to get a common style for all code
- If a project needs shared components it should be in the Wolverine ecosystem
- Write tests
  - Test the end result (does the article components have an href etc.)
  - Write integration tests
  - Check out basic Jest example (when Just is finished)
  - Check out basic Storybook example (when Just is finished)
- Be critical to third party packages
  - Always check if there already is something in the package file that does what you need
  - If it’s a small package: maybe just copy-paste code instead of adding a dependency?
- Write documentation
  - Please write some comments about what your function does
  - Check for documentation in code reviews
- Do code reviews
  - Also do code reviews for quick fixes
